# About Me

Hi! My name is Natalie Leaist and I am an Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, also planning to minor in honours math. I am passionate about combining my love for math and physics with software, electrical and mechanical engineering. I love hands-on work and problem solving, as well as collaborating with others. I currently have a 94.5% (A+) cumulative average.

I have five years of programming experience, ranging from high school computer science courses to my work on the UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team. I also started a girls' coding club at my high school. I have built a strong foundation in C, C++, Python and Java. Additionally, I also have beginner knowledge in javascript and MATLAB. 

I am a member on the UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team. I previously worked on firmware on the command and data handling subteam. Now, I am a member of the Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS) Subteam, where I am helping design and build a Helmholtz cage to be used for satellite testing. On the AOCS subteam, I am gaining experience working with modelling, sensors, and control systems. 

This summer, I worked as a research intern at UBC's Experimental Cosmology Lab, on the CGEM project, a telescope that will be used to help detect gravitational waves from the early universe. I helped design the accelerometer system for the rotating telescope mount. 

Beyond engineering, I am also an avid skier and enjoyer of the outdoors. I moved to Whistler in 2021 and began competing in Freeride Skiing. Freeride skiing is a type of skiing that takes place on high alpine terrain with lots of cliffs. I competed in Freeride Skiing for 3 seasons at the North American Level. In my first season (2021-2022), I finished 5th in Canada, and in my second season (2022-2023), I finished 2nd in Canada. I also qualified for the Junior World Championships in Kappl, Austria. 

When I moved to Whistler, I also took advantage of other unique opportunities. I learned to mountain bike, becoming a certified instructor in my second season of riding. I also worked for two summers as an outdoor adventure guide on Canada’s 2nd longest zipline.

If you’d like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out. I’d love to hear from you!
